# Project Overview
## Tools Used:
- **SQL Server Management Studio** for data manipulation and querying
- **Power BI** for visualization and interactive dashboard creation
  
## Insights
- Location Impact: Proximity to Melbourne's city center significantly influences property prices. Suburbs closer to the center generally show higher property prices, highlighting location as a critical factor.
- Room Count and Price Correlation: Properties with more rooms tend to have higher prices, indicating that property size and amenities play a vital role in property valuation.
- Historical Price Trends: Recent construction years show varied price trends, which may reflect shifts in demand, urban development, or construction quality.

## Recommendations
- For Buyers: Consider suburbs that are slightly further from the city center to find more affordable options without sacrificing essential amenities.
- For Investors: High-growth suburbs with steadily increasing property prices may offer valuable investment opportunities.
- For Sellers: Emphasizing property features like room count can attract higher offers, as homes with more rooms typically command higher prices.
